### TODO

- Set up a react project with redux and redux observable.
- Create service that calls a weather api. For example https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?area=FL
- Create a component that can display some of the weather data when the page loads
- Using redux and store state show a spinner while the weather data is loading
- Use a redux observable epic to retrieve the the weather data and store the weather data in the application state.
- Display the weather data on the component using the application state.

### Bonus points

- Show a message on screen when the call to the weather api fails
- Add the ability to show multiple weather componets, each showing weather from a different area
